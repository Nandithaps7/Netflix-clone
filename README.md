# Netflix UI Clone

This project is a frontend-only clone of the Netflix website created using HTML and CSS.  
The goal of this project is to recreate the overall user interface and browsing experience of Netflix, focusing on layout, styling, and page navigation rather than functionality.

It includes multiple pages that represent different sections of a typical streaming platform, such as movies, TV shows, and saved content.
